# Reference Database

# 1. MouseBrain_Zhang2014
* We have generated a human reference in this folder by mapping mouse gene to human gene.

* Ref. Zhang, Y., et al. An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex. J Neurosci 2014;34(36):11929-11947.


# 2. BrainDev_AllenBrain
* Human brain development reference is built from Allen Human Brain Development Database.

* We have generated a mouse reference in this folder by mapping human gene to mouse gene.

# 3. Gtex_Tissue
* Tissue reference is built from RNA-seq data of The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (human).

* We have generated a mouse reference in this folder by mapping human gene to mouse gene.
