# Data Type

Mouse, UMI

# Data Source:

This reference is built from Tabula Muris single-cell RNA-seq Data

# Workflow:

* For each gene in each cell type, we add all UMI up.

* Detailed scripts are in: https://github.com/jumphone/scRef/tree/master/scripts/TabulaMuris

* We have generated a human reference by mapping mouse gene to human gene.
