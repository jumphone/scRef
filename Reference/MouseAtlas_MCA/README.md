# Data Type

Mouse, single-cell RNA-seq UMI

# Data Source:

This reference is built from Mouse Cell Atlas (MCA) single-cell RNA-seq Data

# Workflow:

* For each cell type, we sum all UMI count.

* Detailed scripts are in: https://github.com/jumphone/scRef/tree/master/scripts/MCA

* We have generated a human reference by mapping mouse gene to human gene.
