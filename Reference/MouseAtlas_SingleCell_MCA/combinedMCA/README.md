# Notice:

If you know the tissue type of your sample, we recommend using tissue-separated reference files (MCA_ref.zip).

# Reason:

1. Too many cell types in the combined file (>200), it will take more time when doing annotation.

2. The sequencing quality of different tissues in MCA may not be the same.
