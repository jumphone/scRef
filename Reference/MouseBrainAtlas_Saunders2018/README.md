# Workflow:

* We use the meta information and count data provided in "metacells.BrainCellAtlas_Saunders_version_2018.04.01.RDS" and "annotation.BrainCellAtlas_Saunders_version_2018.04.01.RDS", respectively.

* Detailed scripts are in: https://github.com/jumphone/scRef/tree/master/scripts/MBA/

* We have generated a human reference by mapping mouse gene to human gene.
